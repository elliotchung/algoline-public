# algonline-public
Partly based on the explanation of algolines described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/rf6crv/what_are_algo_lines/)

## What does this code do?
1. [data_collection.ipynb](https://github.com/elliotchung/algoline-public/blob/main/data_collection.ipynb) pulls the required data from wrds and transform the data suitable for calculating trendlines.
2. [app.ipynb](https://github.com/elliotchung/algoline-public/blob/main/app.ipynb) outlines the code which calculates the trendlines
